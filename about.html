   <p>Hi everyone, my name is Tyler Demers and I am a rising sophomore at the University of Rhode Island. This web page was made for my csc 106 class and will be <br>
     used to store work that we do. I am from Tewksbury, Massachusetts and like to play sports, my favorite is soccer, and hang out with my friends. I also like to <br> 
     travel and have visted 5 countries. My offical major is still up in the air at the moment, but I am in the process of figuring that all out. I spend most of my <br> 
     time right now with my dog or at work. Hope everyone has a good summer and go Bruins! </p>
